Software
Software refers to the set of instructions or programs that are designed to perform specific tasks or functions on a computer system. It is a collection of digital data that tells the computer how to perform certain operations, such as executing a program, manipulating data, or controlling hardware devices.

Software can be divided into two main categories: system software and application software. System software is responsible for managing and controlling the computer hardware, while application software is designed to perform specific tasks or functions for the user, such as word processing, spreadsheet creation, or video editing.

Software is an essential component of modern computing and is used in a wide range of industries and applications, from business and education to entertainment and scientific research.
